 # DiTEC-WDN

This is the official repository for the paper:  
**DiTEC-WDN: A Large-Scale Dataset of Hydraulic Scenarios across Multiple Water Distribution Networks**.

This repository contains configuration optimization, scenario generation, and encapsulation code for the **DiTEC-WDN** dataset.

This is useful for individuals or organizations to generate scenarios on their own private Water Distribution Networks. 

Those interested in the data can directly refer to the [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rugds/ditec-wdn).
